# Causal
Causal is a Reliable Causal Broadcast (RCB) protocol implemented in Rust and Actix.

The protocol is an adaptation from [this article](https://bartoszsypytkowski.com/operation-based-crdts-protocol) which is a great
read for anyone wanting to try and learn more about operation-based CRDTs.

_Please note that the work on this protocol has just been started and there are for sure bugs and features that must be solved/added._
